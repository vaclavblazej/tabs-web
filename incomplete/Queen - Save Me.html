[Verse]

   G        D     Em7     G
It started off so well
             C      G       Am
They said we made a perfect pair
  C         D           G               C
I clothed myself in your glory and your love 
      G
How I loved you
      D
How I cried...
    Am            G   C  Csus2 C 
The years of care and lo-yal--ty   
     Am            C     G   D   D sus4 D
Were nothing but a sham it seems
    C       D      G       C
The years belie we lived a lie
   G        Cadd9 G
"I love you till I die"


[Chorus]

D        A        Bm7  D
Save me, save me, save me 
                   E7    A    G
I cant't face this life alone
D        A        D     G     Gm
Save me, save me, save  me...
    D             C G     D
I'm naked and I'm far from home
  

[Verse]

    G           D       Em7   G
The slate will soon be clear
       C       G    Am 
I'll erase the memories
   C       D         G       C 
To start again with somebody new
           G
It was all waisted
          D
All that love?...
  Am           G     C Csus2 C
I hang my head and I adver---tise
  Am        C   G    D  Dsus4 D
A soul for sale or rent
  C         D        G      C
I have no heart  I'm cold inside  
  G       Cadd9 G
I have no real intent


[Chorus]

D       A       Bm7  D
Save me save me save me
                E7     A    G
I can't face me life alone

D        A        D    G  Gm
Save me, save me, save me
    D             C   G    Am
I'm naked and I'm far from home


[Solo]

G  D  Em7  G  C  G  Am  C  D  G  C  G  D


[Outro]

C             D            G         C
Each night I cry I still belive the lie
  G        Cadd9 G 
I love you till I die
D         A       Bm7  D  E7 A G D         A        D     G    Gm
Save me, save me, save me        Save me, save me, oooh save me
      D              E7   A     G
Don't let me face my life alone
D        A        D    G    Gm
Save me, save me  oooooohhh
    D             C   G    A
I'm naked and I'm far from home
