From Tim's new arena tour. Of course it doesn't compare to the man himself and his 
gigantic orchestra, but it's something to play along with if you enjoy the song and/or want 
to spread the message about rationalism. Enjoy! And buy the album!


[Verse 1] G G F C
    Somewhere in your wardrobe I'd be willing to bet
    there's a t-shirt probly bearing the silhouette of Che Guevara

    He was revolutionary, yeah, he wore a cool hat
    but behind the design I think you might find it's not quite as simple as that
    Bb5                           A5                             G
    Che was a bit of a homophobe, Che was a bit of a homophooooobe   [x2]

[Chorus]
               G         Bm                 C
    This is a song in defence of the fence
                            D
    A little sing along, an anthem to ambivalence
        D#                                Bb
    The more you know the harder you will find it
                    F                                      D#
    To make up your mind it doesn't really matter if you find
                                    D#
    You can't see which grass is greener
                     Bb                          F
    Chances are it's neither and either way it's easier
                    D#                 F               G
    To see the difference  when you're sitting on the fence


[Verse]
    Somewhere in your house I'd be willing to bet
    there's a picture of that grinning hippy from Tibet - the Dalai Llama

    He's a lovely, funny fella, he gives soundbites galore
    but let's not forget that back in Tibet those funky monks used to dick the poor yeah

    And the Buddhist line about future lives is the perfect way to stop the powerless rising up
    And he tells the poor they will live again, but he's rich now so it's easy for him to say

[Chrous]
    I'm taking a staaand in defence of the fence
    I got a little band playing anthems to ambivalence
    We divide the world into terrorists and heroes
    Into normal folk and weirdos, into good people and paedos
    Into things that give you cancer and the things that cu-ure cancer
    And the things that don't cause cancer, but there's a chance they will cause cancer  in the future
    We divide the world to stop us feeling frightened
    Into wrong and into right and into black and into white and
    into real men and fairies, into status quo and scary
    yeah we want the world binary, binary, but it's not that simple.

    And your dog has a bigger carbon footprint than a four wheel drive  [3x]
    Well so does your baby, maybe you oughta trade HIM in for a Prius


ROCK! (no idea how this would work on an acoustic, but if you want you can hit an F for 
a few bars while shaking your head around like a maniac)

[Chorus]
    I'm having a rant in defence of the fence
    I got a sixty piece band playing tributes to ambivalence
    We divide the world into liberals and gun-freaks
    Into atheists and fundies, into tee-tot'lers and junkies
    Into chemical and natural, into fictional and factual
    Into science and supernatural, but it's actually naturally not that white and black  you'll be
    Dividing us into terrorists and heroes
    Into normal folk and weirdos, into good people and paedos
    Into things that give you cancer and the things that cu-ure cancer
    And things that don't cause cancer, but there's a chance thay will cause cancer  in the future
    We divide the world to stop us feeling frightened
    Into wrong and into right and into black and into white and
    into real men and fairies, into parrots and canaries
    yeah we want the world binary, binary, 01 001 000!

    You can't see which grass is greener

    To see the difference because it's not that simple.
