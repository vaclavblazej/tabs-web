[Intro]

[Verse 1]       C       F           C        F
    When you're weary,        feeling small,
    F     Bb    F   C          F             C         F    C     F
    When tears are in your eyes,     i will dry them all
    C     G   Am      G         G7          C
     I'm on your side.    when times get rough
    C7                  F    D   G
     And friends just can't be found,

[Chorus]
    C7        F      F#dim  C    A7sus A7   F
     Like a bridge over troubled wa-ter
            E7      Am
    I will lay me down.
    C7        F      F#dim  C   A7sus A7   F
     Like a bridge over troubled wa-ter
            G9  G7  C
    I will lay me down.

[Verse 2]
    When you're down and out,
    When you're on the street,
    When eve-ning falls so hard
    I will comfort you.
     I'll take your part.
    When darkness comes
     And pains is all a-round,

[Chorus]
     Like a bridge over troubled wa-ter
    I will lay me down.
     Like a bridge over troubled water
    I will lay me down.

[Instrumental]

    C    F     C    F

[Verse 3]
    Sail on silvergirl,
    Sail on by.
     Your time has come to shine.
    All your dreams are on their way.
     See how they shine.
    If you need a friend
     I'm sailing right be-hind.

[Chorus]
     Like a bridge over troubled water
    I will ease your mind.
    your mind
