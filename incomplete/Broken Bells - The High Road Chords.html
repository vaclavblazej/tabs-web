Broken Bells - The High Road

Intro:   Dm  C   G  (repeat)

Dm      C    G        Dm          C       G      Dm
We're bound wait all night She's bound to run amuck
   C         Am     G                   Dm
Invested in nothing any how To each his own

      C        G      Dm         C             G   Dm
The garden is sorting out  She curls her lips on a bar
C        Am             G                     Dm
I don't know if you're dead or not  If you're anyone

     C               G   Dm    C           G        Dm
Come on and get the minimum Before you openup your eyes
      C       Am       G           Dm
This army has so many heads to analyze
     C               G     Dm      C             G     Dm
Come on and get your overdose Collected at the borderlines
      C          Am          G
They want to get up in your head
CHORUS:
      Dm          C    G         Dm           C         G
Cause we know and so do I   The high road is hard to find
   Dm        C        G        Dm              C       G
A detour in your new life Tell all of your friends goodbye

The dawn to end all nights   That's all we hoped it was
A break from the warfare in your heart    To each his own
The soldier is bailing out And curled his lips on a bar
And I don't know if the dead can talk To anyone
  
Come on and get the minimum Before you openup your eyes
This army has so many heads   Are you one of us
Come on and get your overdose Collected at the borderlines
They want to get up in your head

TO CHORUS

INTERLUDE:    F G Dm      F G F  G7

C                  F
It's too late to change your mind
        Dm            G
You let laws be your guide
