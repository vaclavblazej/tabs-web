Far Far Away - Noddy Holder and Dave Lea

[Intro]
Bm  A  Bm  A  Bm  A

[Verse]
              Bm               A               Bm     A
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
              Bm             A                      Bm   Bsus2 Bm
I've seen the bridges of the world and they are for real
           G                 A                D     Dsus2  D
I've had a red light off-the-wrist without me even getting kissed
   G                A
It still seems so unreal
              Bm             A             Bm     A
I've seen the morning in the mountains of Alaska
              Bm            A               Bm   Bsus2 Bm
I've seen the sunset in the East and in the West
              G              A        
I've sang the glory that was Rome
                D          Dsus2    D
And passed the 'Hound Dog' singer's home
   G                   A 
It still seems for the best


[Chorus]
        D    D/C# D/B  D/A
And I'm far, far away
        G              A
With my head up in the clouds
        D    D/C# D/B  D/A
And I'm far, far away
        G                A
With my feet down in the crowds
        D       D/C#     D/B  D/A
Letting loose around the world
        G               F#
But the call of home is loud
         Bm    A  Bm   A   Bm   A
Still as loud


[Verse]
              Bm                A             Bm      A
I've seen the Paris lights from high upon Montmartre
             Bm              A               Bm    Bsus2 Bm
And felt the silence hanging low in No Man's Land
                 G                   A
And though those Spanish nights were fine
          D    Dsus2    D
It wasn't only from the wine
   G                  A
It still seems all in hand


[Chorus]

[Verse]
              Bm               A               Bm     A
I've seen the yellow lights go down the Mississippi
            Bm          A             Bm   Bsus2 Bm
The Grand Bahama Island stories carry on
                 G        A 
And though those aligator smiles
             D      Dsus2 D
Stay in your memory for a while
      G                   A
There still seems more to come
