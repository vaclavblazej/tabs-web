[Intro]

[Verse male]
    From the dusty May sun
    Her looming shadow grows
    Hidden in the branches
    of the poison creosote

    She twines her spines up slowly
    Towards the boiling sun
    And when I touched her skin
    My fingers ran with blood

[Verse female]
    In the hushing dusk
    Under a swollen silver moon
    I came walking with the wind
    To watch the cactus bloom

    And strange hands halted me,
    The looming shadows danced
    I fell down to the thorny brush
    And felt the trembling hands

[Verse]
  [male]
    When the last light warms the rocks
    And the rattlesnakes unfold
  [female]
    Mountain cats will come
    to drag away your bones
  [both]
    And rise with me forever
    Across the silent sand
    And the stars will be your eyes
    And the wind will be my hands
