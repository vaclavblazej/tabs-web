[Intro]
    C G F C F C D7 G
    C G F C F G C  G

[Verse 1]
    It's nine o'clock on a Saturday
    The regular crowd shuffles in
    There's an old man sitting next to me
    Making love to his tonic and gin

    He says, "Son, can you play me a memory
    I'm not really sure how it goes
    But it's sad and it's sweet and I knew it complete
    When I wore a younger man's clothes."

[Interlude]
    Am              D7
    la la la, di da da
    Am           D7    G  F C G7
    La la, di di da da dum

[Chorus]
    Sing us a song, you're the piano man
    Sing us a song tonight
    Well, we're all in the mood for a melody
    And you've got us all feeling alright

[Verse 2]
    Now John at the bar is a friend of mine
    He gets me my drinks for free
    And he's quick with a joke and he'll light up your smoke
    But there's some place that he'd rather be

    He says, "Bill, I believe this is killing me."
    As the smile ran away from his face
    "Well I'm sure that I could be a movie star
    If I could get out of this place"

[Interlude]

[Verse 3]
    Now Paul is a real estate novelist
    Who never had time for a wife
    And he's talking with Davy, who's still in the Navy
    And probably will be for life

    And the waitress is practicing politics
    As the businessman slowly gets stoned
    Yes, they're sharing a drink they call loneliness
    But it's better than drinking alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
    It's a pretty good crowd for a Saturday
    And the manager gives me a smile
    'Cause he knows that it's me they've been coming to see
    To forget about life for a while

    And the piano, it sounds like a carnival
    And the microphone smells like a beer
    And they sit at the bar and put bread in my jar
    And say, "Man, what are you doing here?"

[Interlude]
[Chorus]
