[Intro]

[Verse]
    And I wanted that heat so bad i could taste the fire on your breath
    And I wanted in your storm so bad i could taste the lightning on your breath
    I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death

[Pre-chorus]
    He grew so pale next to you
    The world is so pale next to you

[Chorus]
    Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
    Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

    Am G Dm Am

[Verse]
    You said every road is a good road    Between the
    next road and your last road
    Every love is your best love
    And every love is your last love
    And every kiss is a goodbye
    Every kiss is a goodbye
    I watched you hold the son in your arms while he bled to death

[Pre-chorus]
    He grew so pale next to you
    The world is so pale next to you

[Chorus]
    Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
    Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black
    Your hair is coxcomb red your eyes are viper black

[Outro]
    Am G Dm Am
    Am G Dm Am


[Fingerstyle]
    he plays chords and picks one string from that chord right after
