[Intro]

[Verse 1]
    Em                    G6
    No one knows what it's like
              D2
    To be the bad man
              Cad2
    To be the sad man
              A
    Behind blue eyes

    And no one knows what it's like
    To be hated
    To be faded
    To telling only lies

[Chorus]     C D                   G
    But my dre-ams they aren't as empty
           C         D        E5  [throw in Esus4]
    As my conscience seems to be
            Bm            C
    i have hours, only lonely
                D                      A
    My love is vengeance that's never free

[Verse 2]
    No one knows what it's like
    To feel these feelings,
    Like I do
    And I blame you!

    No one bites back as hard
    On their anger
    None of my pain woe
             Asus2
    Can show through

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 3]  Em G D D  C C A A
    No one knows what it's like
    To be mistreated
    To be defeated
    Behind blue eyes

    No one know how to say
    That they're sorry
    And don't worry
    I'm not telling lies

[repeat Chorus]

[Verse 4 (end)]
    No one knows what it's like
    To be the bad man
    To be the sad man
    Behind blue eyes

[extra]
    In the clouds
    All the graves
    I'll stay if you
    Go away
    Concrete
    Tall as the sky
    Movement passi'n me by
    When you blush
    What a rush
    Reminisce
    Cold crush
    Next door ear to the wall
    All the tension on me for the call
    I wish I wish
    I wish it was all that easy
    I wish I wish
    I wish it was all that easy
