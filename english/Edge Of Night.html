[Verse]
    Am                  Em    Am
    Home is behind, the world ahead,
        Am             Em       Am
    And there are many paths to tread

            Am             G       Am
    Through shadows to the edge of night,
      Am            Em       Am
    Until the stars are all alight.
    Mist and shadow, clo-o-oud and shade,
    All shall fade! All shall fade!
