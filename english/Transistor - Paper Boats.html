[Intro]

[Verse]
    Seconds march  in-to the past
    The moments pass   and just like that  they're gone

    The river always finds the sea
    So helplessly   like you find me   we are
    Paper boats floating on a stream
    And it would seem   we'll never be apart

[Chorus]
    I will al-ways find you   like it's written in the stars
    You can run, but you can't hi-de   try

[Verse]
    Like the moon that makes the tides
    That silent guide   is calling from inside

    And pull me here and push me there
    It's everywhere   hanging in the air   we are
    Magnets pulling from different poles
    with no control    we'll never be apart

[Chorus]
    I will al-ways find you   like it's written in the stars
    You can run, but you can't hi-de   try

[Bridge]
    I will always, always find you
    I will always
    I will always, always find you
    I will always

[Chorus 2x]
    I will always find you
    Like it's written in the stars
    We can run, but we can't hide
    Try

[Outro]
    I will always, always find you
    I will always
